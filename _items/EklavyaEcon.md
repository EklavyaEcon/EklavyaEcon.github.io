In the state of **Maharashtra**,<font color="indianred"> the core components of academia in the fields of economics and policy are frequently left unaddressed in formal education.</font> This absence of explicit teaching leaves aspiring academics in a predicament, as they are expected to acquire these crucial skills and knowledge "along the way." Unfortunately, many individuals face limitations due to a lack of accessible resources and limited opportunities for this type of learning.

Furthermore, even for established academics, there remains <font color="indianred"> a dearth of awareness regarding the existence and availability of valuable online resources that can aid in the understanding of essential subjects like econometrics.</font> These resources, which offer valuable insights and practical guidance, are not widely known or utilized within the academic student community.

In light of these challenges, <font color="indianred"> Eklavya have taken the initiative to compile a comprehensive collection of resources</font>.we believe that they can be instrumental in supporting others in their pursuit of knowledge and understanding in the fields of economics and policy. By sharing these resources, we hope to bridge the gap in learning opportunities and empower first generation learners to enhance their academic capabilities.

Team Eklavya
