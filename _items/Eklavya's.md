In 1905, a man working as a low-level clerk in a patent office published a scientific paper. It wasn’t just any paper, but the start of a whole new era! This man was physicist Einstein. After finishing grad school, he couldn’t find a job and had no money, so he took up small tutoring jobs. Thanks to a friend's father, he finally got a job at the patent office. In his spare time, using only pen and paper, he studied the wonders of the universe. His theory of relativity changed the way people understood physics, challenging ideas that had stood for centuries!
